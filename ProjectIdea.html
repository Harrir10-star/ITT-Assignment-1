    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>Peamble to be developed</p>
        <h3> Overview Personal IT Data Aggregator</h3>
              <p>The idea is to aggregate details from a multitude of sites that a household uses. In its basic form it will provide organisation or filing however the use of the data will be much, much more powerful.</p>
              <p> While there are sites out there that aggregate to pay bills or at least provide reminders there is nothing that is simple or delivers technology that is capable of aggregating a households data. Therefore, I propose to build an application that will bring together the data sets of many of the sites I need to access either to update details or keep track of the data shared.</p>
              <p>The users will need to identify the sites that they will add, most likely this will require user ids and passwords (presenting a security risk - scrape the information into its cloud database), or in the instance of a big 4 bank directly link to an API</p>
            <h3> Motivation</h3>
              <p>This is born from the frustration I feel when I need to locate details from a utility bill or an expense(rates, dog registration, water, electricity, gas, Citylink, myki, school fees, telephone, internet), review, update or renew my insurances (cars, caravan, house, health), renew memberships( football, basketball, gym). </p>
              <p> Some of this is held in individual sites others are just paper based. I’m sure that this is a huge issue for many households, particularly those that are time poor or poor at organisation.</p>
              <p>And don’t get me started on the multitude of passwords & or security mechanisms required to access.</p>
            <h3> Description</h3>
                <p>The way this works is very simple. A user interface that has six sections, once set up this would change to suit the user (refer landing page picture).</p>
                <p>The user will enter details of the sites they want to link. They will need to enter the User id & password (accept Banking) of that site.</p>
                <p>The app will then scrape the data from the site (research will need to be completed in relation to what data can be pulled – it’s likely that if we were to pull data from a site that the fields will be named differently and the information will be displayed differently – including but not limited to different measurements) and pull this back into its database.</p>
                <p> Another option for the longer-term viability is to have arrangements with the issuer via API’s. The major banks are required to meet regulations in to open banking, in addition they are happy to partner with start-ups that have a point of difference. The tier 2 Banks are working on their open banking offerings, with different timelines to the majors. I would look to link to the banks API’s to pull the relevant information</p>
                <p>Banking information, with household information will help with the loan &/or rent application process. All of the legitimate Information should be coming the relative sites – however the banking information will provide a further payment validation of the information represented.
  <p>It is likely that some items may need to be input manually(scanned) in order to provide a full picture. Therefore, will need to ability to do this.</P>
    <p>Once the information has been successfully updated within the app the power will come from the ability to arrange the information in a way that is actionable. </P>
  <p>Bill amounts could be added to a budget page. We could display the details on when all are due for renewal and schedule a review period, with the information fed directly in to a compare the market or Iselect type tool. Imagine if they could bring in the details around your gas consumption – then compare the information available online and give you apples for apples comparison without you having to do the calculations. </p>
  <p>We could set up an extract that could be built to estimate the weekly/fortnightly, monthly amount required to payed and extract a feed that would be uploaded directly into a banking app or simply have a two-\ way feed to the API.</p>
  <p>There would be information pages.– as an example I.e. all the detail of the car insured – Registration, type of policy, who is insured, details of the car( make, model, badge, year, style, auto/manual, 4/6/8Cl etc.) amount covered & Listed drivers( Name, DOB, gender) what is include in the insurance, excess, age access, not registered driver </p>
  <p>Lastly there is the potential to further expand the tool to interact with other services like Superannuation, investments and reward program. However, these have not been considered as this adds an extra layer of security complexity and many of the legal issues associated with a breach.</p>

        <h3> Tools & Technology</h3>
          <h4> Software development</h4>
          <p>As this is an App we will be mainly looking at App development tools. I’m a mac user, so the main development tool I will look to use for the app is Xcode.  However, we may need the ability to develop for Android also.</p>
          <p>Xcode allow the ability to create applications for all the different devices (iphone, ipad, mac etc.). It does have workflow with the ability to test and debug.</p>


          <h4> Project management</h4>
          <p>We will also need a project management tool, particularly if we are going to progress down the path of android & apple.. The choice here is to potentially use the xcode flow – however if we look at android as well and other aspects e.g marketing.</p>


          <h4> Data Mining</h4>
          <p>There will be three methods for accessing the data required:</P>
          <p><u> Screen Scraping technology </u>(machine learning, AI etc.) I’m envisaging that the user will input their userID and password then the screen scrapper technology will go to work. Understanding that we will need to have the ability to use AI as the fields may change over time;<p>
          <p><u>API link</u> Direct access to banking details via developer portals. I’ve only had time to do minimal research on this. i.e I haven’t compare the offering of each of the big four banks. I have however looked at ANZ and Nab, both encourage the use of their public API’s.  You are required to meet certain criteria in order to be able to access the data;</P>
          <p><u> Scan Information</u> details that are unable to be sources via a website will require the ability to scan the information – possible in a read write format.</P>


            <h4> Test Environmentents</h4>

            <p>  The testing is a critical part of the release of the App. It is important to do this to make sure :</p>
            <p> + That it operates correctly without bugs;<p>
            <p> + To meet the requirements of the, for example the apple ‘app store’;</p>
            <p> + Given the sensitive data that will be accessed via the app. </p>
            <p> While X-code may have some functionality, I would feel a lot more comfortable having and external party conduct.</p>

  <h3> Skills Required – Possible roles (some will need to be rolled into one)</h3>
