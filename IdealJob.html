    <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>To be perfectly honest I didn’t do this course to get a specific role. I’m actually reasonably happy with the current field I’m in at the moment. Risk and Compliance professionals are in reasonably high demand, particularly off the back of the recent Financial Services Royal Commission. <p>
    <p>So, the role that I have chosen is more of a hypothetical, enabling me to complete a little research to determine what I need to do to become a Security Operations Centre Manager.</p>
    <p>I like dealing with Events and issues, tracking of threat actors and their new tactics. Oh, and it also provides the opportunity to relocate to an exotic location.<p>

    <h3> What is the role</h3>
    <p>The role is leading a team of security professionals in CGI’s Security Operations Centre. CGI is one of the largest IT and business consulting service firms in the world. With a global presence they provide guidance through to managed services.</p>

    <p>It would appear from the description that the role would be involved in pitching the service offerings to prospective companies – This may be a full managed service, hybrid or setting the client up to manage internally. </p>
    <p>They also look to provide auditing services, testing, evaluation and certification services to IT security product businesses.<p>
    <p>It looks as though the manager needs to be proficient in cybersecurity practises, when not pitching to a prospective clients they would be running the operation to protect their existing clients to protect their data and infrastructure in the following areas: </p>
      <style>
      ul.no-bullets {
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

      </style>


      <ul>
        <li>Identity and access management</li>
        <li>Detection of intrusions and response</li>
        <li>Threat hunting</li>
        <li>Forensics on the latest vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Security Incident Event Monitoring (SIEM)   </li>


      </ul>



    <p>The one thing I didn’t have was a real in-depth knowledge of the architecture, the data centres, the applications, middleware, the capacity of servers etc. While being able to talk to technology teams, I wasn’t able to get on the tools myself. One thing that I’ve learnt over the many years it that the best learning I’ve done is actually from the experiences. It would have helped immensely of the period if I had the formal training or experienced an actual specialised Tech role.<p>
    <p>I selected RMIT for two reasons:
•	The curriculum covered the area of technology that I was interested, and I could complete the majority remotely. Noting also that the main campus was near where I worked in the city.
•	It has a great reputation from a technology perspective. Having spoken to a number of people in the industry that had completed their degree’s at RMIT they had nothing but glowing recommendations.

<p>
    <p>Fast forward to now I’m expecting to gain a more in-depth knowledge of IT. As a Risk Manager I’ve found it difficult at time to challenge the business on what can or cannot be done. Often what happened was people who have strong technology backgrounds use technology language which is often complex to explain why something can’t be done or that things need to be done a certain way. Moving forward as an example I want to be able to by -pass the system analyst or project manager and talk directly to a network engineer in detail about a particular solution. </p>
<p>I expect to get hand on with the tools and programming languages. I expect that I will be able to recognise what good programming is and is not, what good architecture is and is not. I expect to get a better understanding of cloud computing technology and what is on the horizon. And I expect to meet and network with many people from various backgrounds and experiences.</p>
<p>In addition, If I do down the track decide I want to go into a more specialised technology role, I will actually have the qualifications to enable this to be a reality.   </p>
