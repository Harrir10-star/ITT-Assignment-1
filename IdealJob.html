    <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>To be perfectly honest I didn&#39;t do this course to get a specific role. I&#39;m actually reasonably happy with the current field I&#39;m in at the moment. Risk and Compliance professionals are in reasonably high demand, particularly off the back of the recent Financial Services Royal Commission. <p>
    <p>So, the role that I have chosen is more of a hypothetical, enabling me to complete a little research to determine what I need to do to become a Security Operations Centre Manager.</p>
    <p>I like dealing with Events and issues, tracking of threat actors and their new tactics. Oh, and it also provides the opportunity to relocate to an exotic location.<p>

    <h3> What is the role</h3>
    <p>The role is leading a team of security professionals in CGI&#39;s Security Operations Centre. CGI is one of the largest IT and business consulting service firms in the world. With a global presence they provide guidance through to managed services.</p>
    <br>

    <p>It would appear from the description that the role would be involved in pitching the service offerings to prospective companies. This may be a full managed service, hybrid or setting the client up to manage internally. </p>
    <p>They also look to provide auditing services, testing, evaluation and certification services to IT security product businesses.<p>
    <p>It looks as though the manager needs to be proficient in cybersecurity practises, when not pitching to a prospective clients they would be running the operation to protect their existing clients to protect their data and infrastructure in the following areas: </p>

<h3> My Plan </h3>

<style>
ul.no-bullets {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

</style>


<ul>
  <li>Complete this course (Bachelor of Information Technology  Undergraduate RMI-CPT-DEG-2020). Completing this course will enable me to at least change the first smiley face to green. </li>
  <li>Extensive IT experience : I don&#39;t have extensive IT expereince, nor can you really get expereince in a short period of time. However i would use my previous experiences in Digital to play up this piece when applying . At my current organisation I would work towards moving into their Cyber security team. To enable this, I would first need to move from Commercial Risk into Technology Risk. And then into the technology business. Working in the technology risk team could be achieved within a year. I wouldn't attempt to move into a business technology role at least until having completed two years of this degree.</li>
  <li>Technical skills : The plan would be to look at these frameworks as part of this course in more detail. i.e where appropriate I would take the relevant electives and/or research these and include as part of my assignments.</p>
    <li> Technicals skills :  Completing any relevant accreditations (e.g. become ISO 27001 certified through a Registered training office. I would also look to attend relevant Cybersecurity events.</li>
